# Coursework
This coursework is designed for you to get a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms. This coursework assumes that you have knowledge in coding, but it does not assume that you have knowledge around LinkedLists, Binary Trees, Sorting algorithms or related. Therefore, it is designed to build up your skills in these topics from level zero.

## Notes
- Each exercise could take you up to 1 hours. Total duration estimation is 30 hours.
- Existing files are Java (`.java`), but feel free to add other languages in the same topic folders—just use the appropriate extension (e.g., `.py`, `.rs`, `.js`) and keep problem names consistent.
- To run a Java solution individually: `make run file=topic1_arrays/AVeryBigSum.java input=sample.txt` (or leave `input` as `/dev/stdin`). Each file compiles to `.build/` with class name `Solution`, so run one at a time.
- Automated samples live in `tests/`; run them all with `./run_tests.sh` (uses the Makefile per solution and compares to the recorded `.out` files).
