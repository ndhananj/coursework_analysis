# Problem Statements

## topic1_arrays
- **AVeryBigSum**: Given n and an array of long integers, compute their total using 64-bit arithmetic and print the sum.
- **DesinerPDFViewer**: Given heights for 26 letters and a word, output the highlighted area as the max letter height times the word length.
- **LeftRotation**: Rotate an array of n integers to the left by d positions and print the resulting order.
- **SparseArray**: Read n strings, then answer q queries by printing how many times each query string appears in the collection.

## topic2_lists
- **InsertNodeAtTail**: Append a node with the given data to the end of a singly linked list and return the head.
- **InsertNodePositionGiven**: Insert a node with the given data at a specified zero-based position in a singly linked list and return the head.
- **IsCycle**: Determine whether a singly linked list contains a cycle.
- **MergeTwoSortedLinkedLists**: Merge two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted list in ascending order.

## topic3_stacks_queues
- **BalancedBrackets**: For each bracket string, print YES if the brackets are balanced and properly nested; otherwise print NO.
- **QueueUsingTwoStacks**: Implement a FIFO queue using two stacks to support enqueue (1 x), dequeue (2), and print-front (3) commands.
- **Waiter**: Given a stack of plate numbers and q iterations, repeatedly partition plates divisible by successive primes into B stacks, then print plates from each B stack followed by the remaining stack.

## topic4_hashmaps
- **ColorfulNumber**: Decide if an integer is colorful—products of all contiguous digit subsequences must be unique; return 1 if colorful else 0.
- **IceCreamParlor**: For each trip, find two ice cream flavors whose costs add up to budget m and output their 1-based indices in ascending order.
- **MigratoryBirds**: Given bird sightings of types 1–5, return the most frequent type (choosing the smallest ID on ties).
- **MissingNumbers**: Given two arrays where the second contains all numbers from the first plus extras, print the sorted numbers missing from the first array.

## topic5_sorting
- **CorrectnessAndTheLoopInvariant**: Fully sort the array using insertion sort to illustrate correctness via the loop invariant.
- **InsertionSortPart2**: Run insertion sort across the array, printing the array after each insertion step.
- **InsertionSortPartI**: With the last element unsorted, shift elements right until it fits and print the array after each shift and insertion.
- **QuicksortPartI**: Partition the array around the first element as pivot and print elements as left segment, pivot, then right segment.

## topic6_trees
- **BinaryTreeInsertion**: Insert a value into a binary search tree, creating nodes as needed, and return the root.
- **HeightOfABinaryTree**: Compute the height (edges on the longest path from root to leaf) of a binary tree.
- **PostorderTraversal**: Print the nodes of a binary tree using postorder traversal (left, right, root).
- **PreorderTraversal**: Print the nodes of a binary tree using preorder traversal (root, left, right).
- **Qheap1**: Process q queries on a min-priority queue: add an element, delete an element, or print the minimum value.
- **SwapNodes**: Given a tree described by child indices and queries k, swap children of all nodes at depths that are multiples of k and print inorder traversal after each swap.

## topic7_graphs
- **BFSShortestReach**: Given an undirected graph with uniform edge weight 6 and a start node, print shortest distances to all other nodes or -1 if unreachable.
- **SnakesAndLadders**: Compute the minimum dice throws to reach square 100 on a board with given ladders and snakes; output -1 if unreachable.

## topic8_recursion
- **Fibonacci**: Compute the nth Fibonacci number using recursion (memoized for efficiency).
- **Print1toNRecursively**: For each test case, recursively print numbers from 1 to n in increasing order.
